# Phenosi's CQB Interaction ACE COMPAT by kolmipilot

This repository contains a standalone version of **Phenosi's CQB Interaction**, made compatible with ACE by kolmipilot. The mod is a minor rebuild based on the original work by Phenosi and Flex7103, link to orginal mod (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3335065609) with adjustments to ensure proper integration with the ACE frameworkâ€”especially with the setting that allows only surrendered units to be detained.

**Note:** This version has not been tested with the original Phenosi's CQB Interaction mod. For best results, use the ACE setting that restricts detaining to surrendered units.

The project is still a work in progress. If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please report them via GitHub Issues or reach out through the Steam Workshop page:
